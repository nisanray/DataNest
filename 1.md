Let‚Äôs build a **super-flexible system** ‚Äî your own no-code data platform!

# ü™∫ **DataNest ‚Äî Unlimited Custom Field Types**

> **‚ÄúNest your data. Define your rules.‚Äù**

---

## üéØ App Vision

**DataNest** is a dynamic data management app where you:

* Create your own **Sections** (categories).
* Define **any fields you can imagine** in each section ‚Äî you, the user, are in total control:
  * Text, Numbers, Dates, Times, Files, Images, Dropdowns, Multi-selects, Toggles, Relations, Computed values... **literally any field type you want.**
  * Set requirements: required, unique, default values, hints.
  * Validation: regex, min/max, allowed values, file types, custom logic.
  * Advanced: Computed fields, conditional visibility, relations between records, dynamic formulas, attachments, and more.
* Add unlimited **Records** under each section.
* Enjoy a **dynamic drawer** that updates as you build out your data structure.
* Store data **locally and synced with Firestore** for offline plus cloud backup.

Imagine building your own Airtable/Notion-style database ‚Äî but with **no limits** on the types of fields you can define!

## üß© Core Concepts

### üîπ Sections

* User-defined groupings for data.
* Attributes:
  * name
  * icon
  * description
  * color
  * order in drawer

---

### üîπ Fields

The heart of flexibility!

#### You Define the Field Types

* **Every field type is user-definable.**
  * If you can imagine a data field, you can create it in DataNest.
  * Examples (but not limited to):
    * Text, Number, Date, Time, DateTime
    * Checkbox, Switch, Toggle
    * Dropdown, Multi-select, Radio Buttons
    * Attachment (image, file, video, audio, links, etc.)
    * Relation (link to any other section or record)
    * Computed/Formula fields
    * Signature, Barcode, Location, Color, Currency, Rating, Password, JSON, Custom Code
    * ‚Ä¶and any custom field you define!

#### Field Attributes

* **Name**
* **Type** (fully customizable by user)
* **Required?**
* **Default Value**
* **Hint/Help Text**
* **Unique?**
* **Allowed options/values**
* **Validation** ‚Äî regex, min/max, file format, etc.
* **Attachment rules** ‚Äî allowed file types, max size, etc.
* **Relations** ‚Äî link to other records/sections
* **Computed/Formula** ‚Äî calculate values dynamically
* **Conditional Visibility** ‚Äî show/hide based on record data
* **Order** ‚Äî drag & drop reordering

#### Example

```json
{
  "name": "Profile Picture",
  "type": "image",
  "required": false,
  "hint": "Upload a recent photo",
  "maxFileSizeMB": 5,
  "allowedTypes": ["jpg", "png"]
}
```

Or, for a **custom field**:

```json
{
  "name": "Risk Level",
  "type": "custom",
  "widget": "slider",
  "min": 1,
  "max": 10,
  "defaultValue": 5
}
```

---

### üîπ Records

Data entered for a section, matching your custom fields.

Example record under ‚ÄúInventory‚Äù:

```json
{
  "Product Name": "Laptop",
  "Specs": {
    "CPU": "i7",
    "RAM": "16GB"
  },
  "Purchase Date": "2024-09-01",
  "Receipt": "file.pdf",
  "Warranty Expiry": "2026-09-01",
  "Tags": ["electronics", "work"],
  "Supplier": "Acme Supplies",
  "Location": {
    "lat": 12.34,
    "lng": 56.78
  }
}
```

## üóÇÔ∏è Dynamic Drawer

* Sections dynamically appear in the app‚Äôs drawer/sidebar.
* Drawer items:
  * Home
  * All user-created sections
* Tap a section ‚Üí shows its records list.

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Structure

### Sections

```json
{
  "id": "sec1",
  "name": "Projects",
  "icon": "folder",
  "color": "#4285F4",
  "description": "Work and personal projects"
}
```

---

### Fields

```json
{
  "id": "fld1",
  "sectionId": "sec1",
  "name": "Due Date",
  "type": "date",
  "required": true,
  "unique": false,
  "defaultValue": "",
  "hint": "Project deadline"
}
```

Or a **custom user-defined field**:

```json
{
  "id": "fld2",
  "sectionId": "sec1",
  "name": "Priority",
  "type": "custom",
  "widget": "dropdown",
  "options": ["Low", "Medium", "High"]
}
```

---

### Records

```json
{
  "id": "rec1",
  "sectionId": "sec1",
  "data": {
    "Project Name": "DataNest MVP",
    "Due Date": "2025-08-01",
    "Priority": "High",
    "Files": ["spec.docx", "logo.png"]
  },
  "synced": false
}
```

* `synced` (bool): Indicates if this record is uploaded to Firestore. If `false`, the app will automatically attempt to upload it when online. Once uploaded, `synced` is set to `true`.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture & Tech Stack

### Frontend (Mobile)

* **Flutter**
* Dynamic drawer
* Dynamic form builder (reads user-defined field types)
* State management:
  * Riverpod / BLoC
* Local DB:
  * **Hive** (recommended)
* Dark/light themes

---

### Local Storage

* Mirror Firestore structure locally.
* Each record includes a `synced` boolean to track upload status.
* Offline edits ‚Üí queued for sync. Unsynced data is uploaded automatically when a connection is available.
* Hive recommended for fast queries.

---

### Cloud Sync

* Firebase Firestore:
  * Collections:
    * **users**
    * **sections**
    * **fields**
    * **records**
* Each record tracks a `synced` boolean to indicate upload status.
* Authentication:
  * Firebase Auth (email/password, Google, etc.)
* Firestore offline persistence enabled.
* Conflict resolution:
  * Last-write-wins or merge logic.
