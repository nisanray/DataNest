# ü™∫ DataNest ‚Äî Unlimited Custom Data Platform

**DataNest** is a next-generation, no-code data platform that empowers you to create, manage, and sync your own custom data structures. With a beautiful, dynamic UI and robust offline/online sync, DataNest is perfect for professionals, teams, and hobbyists who want total control over their data.

## üåü Overview

DataNest is your personal, flexible database builder ‚Äî think of it as a cross between Notion, Airtable, and a spreadsheet, but with **no limits** on the types of data you can model. You define your own categories (Sections), add any fields you want (from simple text to advanced computed fields), and manage unlimited records. All data is stored locally (offline-first) and synced to the cloud (Firestore) for backup and cross-device access.

### Why DataNest?
- **Ultimate Flexibility:** Model any data structure ‚Äî from inventory, contacts, and tasks to scientific research, business assets, or personal collections.
- **No-Code Power:** Build complex forms, relationships, and logic without writing a single line of code.
- **Offline + Cloud:** Work anywhere, sync everywhere. Never lose your data.
- **For Everyone:** Perfect for individuals, teams, small businesses, and power users.
- **Open & Extensible:** Add new field types, logic, and integrations as your needs grow.

### Example Use Cases
- **Inventory Management:** Track products, suppliers, purchase dates, warranty, and more.
- **CRM/Contacts:** Custom contact fields, tags, notes, and relationships.
- **Project Management:** Tasks, deadlines, priorities, attachments, and team assignments.
- **Personal Collections:** Books, movies, recipes, hobbies, and more.
- **Research & Science:** Custom experiment logs, data points, computed results.
- **Business Assets:** Equipment, maintenance, locations, barcodes, and files.

## üöÄ Features (In Detail)

### üß© Data Modeling
- **Unlimited Sections:**

  - Each section has a name, icon, color, and description
  - Reorder sections for custom navigation
- **Custom Fields:**
  - Add any field type to each section
  - **Supported Field Types:**
    - Text, Number, Date, Time, DateTime
    - Checkbox, Switch, Toggle
    - Dropdown, Multi-select, Radio
    - File, Image, Attachment (with file type/size rules)
    - Relation (link to other records/sections)
    - Computed/Formula fields (auto-calculate values)
    - Color, Rating, Password, JSON, Currency, Barcode, Location, Signature, Custom Code
  - **Field Options:**
    - Required, Unique, Default Value, Hint/Help Text
    - Allowed values/options (for dropdowns, multi-select, radio)
    - Validation rules (regex, min/max, file type/size, custom logic)
    - Conditional visibility (show/hide fields based on other data)
    - Drag & drop field reordering
    - Attachments: Restrict file types, max size, image preview
    - Relations: Link to any other section or record
    - Computed: Dynamic formulas, auto-updating fields

### üìù Record Management
- **Dynamic Forms:**
  - Add/edit records with forms generated from your custom fields
  - Each field type gets the right input widget (date picker, dropdown, file picker, etc.)
  - Multi-select, radio, and checkbox fields for rich data entry
- **Validation:**
  - Enforce required, unique, and custom rules at entry
  - Real-time feedback for invalid or missing data
- **Beautiful Record Display:**
  - Records shown in modern cards with icons, field labels, and values
  - Field values formatted and color-coded by type
  - Quick delete/edit with confirmation dialogs
- **Bulk Actions:** (Planned)
  - Select and delete/export multiple records at once

### üóÇÔ∏è Navigation & UI/UX
- **Dynamic Drawer:**
  - Instantly reflects your sections for easy navigation
  - Tap a section to see its records and fields
- **Modern UI:**
  - Responsive, accessible, and beautiful (Material Design)
  - Dark Mode for eye comfort
  - Color & Icon Pickers for sections and fields
  - All notifications (success/error) appear at the bottom for a clean experience
- **Tabs in Section Detail:**
  - Switch between Records, Fields, and Settings for each section
- **Search & Filter:** (Planned)
  - Quickly find records by any field or value

### üõ†Ô∏è Data & Sync
- **Offline-First:**
  - All data is stored locally with Hive for instant access and reliability
- **Cloud Sync:**
  - Automatic sync with Firestore (with `synced` status tracking)
  - Works seamlessly across devices
- **Robust Sync Logic:**
  - On login, all user data is fetched from Firebase and always overwrites Hive, ensuring local data is always up-to-date.
  - The UI always reads from Hive, guaranteeing instant access and correct display even after hot restart.
  - Any new or edited data is saved to Hive with `synced: false` and is automatically uploaded to Firebase when online, then marked as `synced: true`.
  - Extensive debugPrint instrumentation throughout the codebase for easy debugging and tracing of all sync and data actions.
- **Conflict Handling:**
  - Last-write-wins for now (future: merge/resolve)
- **Export/Import:** (Planned)
  - Export sections/records as JSON or CSV

### üîí Security & Extensibility
- **Authentication:** (Planned)
  - Firebase Auth for secure access (email, Google, etc.)
- **Role-based Access:** (Planned)
  - Permissions for teams and shared sections
- **Extensible:**
  - Easily add new field types, logic, and integrations
  - Modular codebase for rapid feature development
