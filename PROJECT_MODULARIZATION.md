# ðŸª´ DataNest Modularization Plan (GetX Version)

A step-by-step guide to building DataNest in small, modular increments using GetX for state management, navigation, and dependency injection. Each step is designed to be self-contained and testable, enabling a maintainable and scalable codebase.

---

## 1. Project Setup
- **Initialize Flutter project**
- Set up version control (Git)
- Configure basic folder structure (lib/, models/, services/, ui/, controllers/, bindings/, etc.)
- Add dependencies: GetX, Hive, Firebase, etc.

---

## 2. Core Data Models
- **Section Model**: id, name, icon, color, description
- **Field Model**: id, sectionId, name, type, required, default, etc.
- **Record Model**: id, sectionId, data, synced
- Write model classes and serialization logic

---

## 3. Local Database Layer
- Integrate Hive for local storage
- Implement CRUD for Sections, Fields, Records
- Add `synced` boolean to Record model

---

## 4. Firestore Integration
- Set up Firebase project
- Integrate Firebase Auth (email/password, Google)
- Implement Firestore sync for Sections, Fields, Records
- Handle `synced` status and automatic upload of unsynced data

---

## 5. GetX State Management & Routing
- Create GetX Controllers for Sections, Fields, Records, Auth, etc.
- Use GetX Bindings for dependency injection
- Set up GetX routing for navigation between pages

---

## 6. Dynamic Drawer UI
- Build a sidebar/drawer that lists all Sections using GetX reactive state
- Add navigation to Section detail screens with GetX routing

---

## 7. Section Management
- UI to create, edit, delete Sections
- Use SectionController for state and logic
- Persist changes locally and sync to Firestore

---

## 8. Field Management
- UI to add, edit, delete Fields within a Section
- Use FieldController for state and logic
- Support all core field types (text, number, date, etc.)
- Persist and sync field definitions

---

## 9. Dynamic Form Builder
- Generate forms dynamically based on user-defined Fields
- Use GetX for form state and validation
- Modularize form widgets for each field type

---

## 10. Record Management
- UI to add, edit, delete Records for a Section
- Use RecordController for state and logic
- Save records locally, mark as `synced: false` if offline
- Automatic sync/upload when online

---

## 11. Advanced Field Types
- Implement attachments (images/files)
- Add support for relations, computed fields, conditional visibility
- Modularize advanced field widgets

---

## 12. Search, Filter, and Export
- Implement search and filter for records using GetX reactive lists
- Add data export (JSON/CSV)

---

## 13. Theming & UX
- Add dark/light mode
- Polish UI for modern, clean experience

---

## 14. Offline/Online Sync & Conflict Resolution
- Ensure robust offline support
- Implement conflict resolution (last-write-wins or merge)

---

## 15. Testing & QA
- Write unit and widget tests for core modules
- Manual QA for all flows

---

## 16. Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Templates, collaboration, analytics, reminders, AI suggestions, etc.

---

**Tip:** Tackle one module at a time. Each step builds on the previous, ensuring a solid, maintainable foundation for DataNest.
